        isIdCurrent is renamed to isPostgresqlIdCurrent.
        row.names is now integer.

Version 0.2-1 -- 2011-11-16

    o   libpq source codes are bundled for Windows.

Version 0.2-0 -- 2011-10-04

    o   Error check for dbWriteTable

    o   dbWriteTable does not write a temporary file.
        Control characters in strings are properly escaped for dbWriteTable.

    o   Remove warning for enum and arrays etc.  The value are still transferred
        as string and not converted to arrays etc.

    o   use c('schema', 'table') to specify schema

    o   Integer is mapped to integer in postgresql rather than bigint.

Version 0.1-7 -- 2010-10-17

    o   Several potential buffer overruns were fixed

    o   dbWriteTable now writes a data.frame to database through a network
        connection rather than a temporary file. Note that row_names may be
        changed in future releases.  Also, passing in filenames instead of
        data.frame is not supported at this time. 

    o   When no host is specified, a connection to the PostgreSQL server 
        is made via UNIX domain socket (just like psql does)

    o   Table and column names are case sensitive, and identifiers are escaped
        or quoted appropriately, so that any form of table/column names can be
        created, searched, or removed, including upper-, lower- and mixed-case.

    o   nullOk in dbColumnInfo has a return value of NA when the column does
        not correspond to a column in the table. The utility of nullOk is
        doubtful but not removed at this time.

    o   Correct Windows getpid() declaration (with thanks to Brian D. Ripley)

    o   A call of as.POSIXct() with a time format string wrongly passed to TZ
        has been corrected; this should help with intra-day timestamps (with
        thanks to Steve Eick)

    o   Usage of tmpdir has been improved on similarly to Linux (with thanks
        to Robert McGehee)

Version 0.1-6 -- 2009-10-19

    o   Added missing paste() call to dbGetQuery() for dbListTables

Version 0.1-5 -- 2009-10-13
