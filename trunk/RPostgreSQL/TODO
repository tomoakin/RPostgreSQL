Things yet to be Completed:
1. Complete the dbWriteTable part
   [To be improved: try to implement this using network connections ]
2. Add the commands for transaction management.
   [DONE: Added dbBeginTransaction, dbRollback and dbCommit]
3. Add hostadr to the connection string & make corresponding changes.
   (Dont forget to check RCMD check) and try to add the functionality
   to specify the connection parameters in any order.
   [DONE: follow-up analysis revealed that hostaddr
   was not needed as host could take numeric address]
4. Matching between the error messages & error codes in pg. [DONE]
5. In dbGetInfo(rs), $fieldDescription[[1]]$Sclass & $fieldDescription
   [[1]]$type are displaying numbers instead of words (like in
   SQLite). So Correct the code. [DONE]
6. Scale & nullOk are not given values yet in dbGetInfo(result_set)
   because of lack of functions in pg. So Remove them or try to
   hardcode the appropriate details in the code.For more details
   refer to : "RS_PostgreSQL_createDataMappings".
   [DONE: Added an SQL query to do that]
7. Make test script & a test folder. 
8. Improve the documentation & remove the examples from don't run
   mode.
9. Just verify whether all the key words are included in the reserved
   keywords section. [DONE]
10.Add the mappings for all the datatypes in RS-PostgreSQL.h 
11.Check whether it works in windows or not & make corresponding changes.
12.Check whether all the data mappings are working perfectly fine &
   finetune some datatypes like date,blobs etc..For checking, perform    
   this test. Try to convert a data to & fo via R & pg and see whether   
   datatype is being preserved. [Partially Done]
13.In RS_PostgreSQL_connectionInfo, you are assigning threadid to
   processid. So Check that.
   [DONE: changed the name from thread to backendPId]
14.Add comments to the code & some extra files for information sake as   
   in RMySQL & RSQLite. 
15.Replace all occurrences of the old 'T' and 'F' with 'TRUE' and 'FALSE' [DONE]
16.Add commands for prepared statements.
17.Check the working of DBI extension "dbApply".
