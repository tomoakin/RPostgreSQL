About the RPostgreSQL package:

    Database Interface between R and PostgreSQL

For details, see the Adobe PDF file "DBI.pdf" in the doc folder or see the
documentation using help(PostgreSQL).  Demos are provided in the devTests
folder for illustrating the working.

Basic usage:
------------
  ## initialize the driver to PostgreSQL
  drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")

  ## create a connection to a PostgreSQL server
  con <- dbConnect(drv,user="userName", password="123456",
                        dbname="gsoc", host="10.23.34.23")

  ## run a query, leave results on the server
  rs <- dbSendQuery(con, "select * from someTable")

  ## fetch up to, say, 50 records
  dFrame <- fetch(rs, n = 50)

  ## close resultSet rs 
  dbClearResult(rs)

  ## close connection con
  dbDisconnect(con)

  ## Unload the driver drv
  dbUnloadDriver(drv)

*** for better understanding of commands, refer to demo.r in the devTests folder.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):

1Q. What is Database Interface(DBI) ?
A.  The Data Base Interface (DBI) provides a layer of abstraction between R
    and relational databases. All the classes in the DBI package are virtual
    and need to be implemented using the various DBMS libraries. The vendor
    has written some functions for communicating with the database in some
    language like C, compiled the functions and the compiled code is the
    library. We write a C program that calls the functions in the library,
    when it wants to access the database. Every database library is
    different. The names of the functions vary, and the order in
    which you call them varies, and the details of passing queries to the
    functions and getting the data back out will vary. To manage this, DBI
    was extended for individual database back-ends MySQL, SQLite, Oracle,
    PostgreSQL via R packages ROracle, RMySQL, RSQLite and RPostgreSQL. 
    DBI for R-language was initially developed at Bell Labs by David James.

2Q. What is RPostgreSQL ?
A.  The RPostgreSQL package provides a glue between the PostgreSQL database
    and the DBI of R. The C programming interface called libpq was used for
    communicating with PostgreSQL. 

3Q. What is libpq ?
A.  libpq is the C application programmer’s interface to PostgreSQL. libpq is
    a cross platform library providing set of library functions
    that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL backend server
    and to receive the results of these queries.

Important Information:

1. dbWriteTable method is found to fail in some flavours of Linux like RedHat
   distributions because of SELinux. SELinux is preventing PostgreSQL to
   access data from locations other than it's data folder. So one of the
   possible quick solutions is to turn off SELinux temporarily while using
   this method and turn on later.

## To turn off the SELinux, type the following at the command prompt
$ echo 0 > /selinux/enforce/
## To turn on the SElinux, type the following at the command prompt
$ echo 1 > /selinux/enforce/

2. The present version of RPostgreSQL can handle only one resultset per connection.

3. PostgreSQL treats table and column names as case insensitive. So always
   lowercase names are returned in PostgreSQL and hence in RPostgreSQL.
