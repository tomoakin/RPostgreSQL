## Class: dbObjectId

## This package was developed as a part of Summer of Code program organized by Google.
## Thanks to David A. James & Saikat DebRoy, the authors of RMySQL package.
## Code from RMySQL package was reused with the permission from the authors.
## Also Thanks to my GSoC mentor Dirk Eddelbuettel for helping me in the development.

## This mixin helper class is NOT part of the database interface definition,
## but it is extended by the Oracle, MySQL,PostgreSQL and SQLite implementations
## to allow us to conviniently (and portably)
## implement all database foreign objects methods (i.e., methods for show(),
## print() format() the dbManger, dbConnection, dbResultSet, etc.)
## A dbObjectId is an  identifier into an actual remote database objects.
## This class and its derived classes <driver-manager>Object need to
## be VIRTUAL to avoid coercion (green book, p.293) during method dispatching.
