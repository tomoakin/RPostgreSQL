Version 0.4 -- 2013-03-27

    o   Initial implementation of prepared statement

    o   Use system libpq library when available on OS X (darwin)

    o   Force ISO datestyle for PostgreSQL-R communication by default

    o   Time zone aware Timestamp POSIXct conversion

Version 0.3-3 -- 2012-10-05

    o   Bugfix on dbColumnInfo and others reproducible by gctorture(TRUE)

    o   Do not implicitly make new connections, which interfere with transaction.

    o   Change the notation of the LICENSE

Version 0.3-2 -- 2012-01-10

    o   Adapt to the new windows toolchain.

    o   Do not make libpq.dll on windows but just make libpq.a and link it,
        so that libpq.dll need not copied anymore.

Version 0.3-1 -- 2011-12-31

    o   Remove GNU make dependency.

Version 0.3-0 -- 2011-12-29

    o   The bundled libpq source codes are used under darwin as well.

    o   More compatibility to other database drivers under DBI and sqldf.
        dbBeginTransaction, safe.write, make.db.names are removed.
        dbBuildTableDefinition is renamed to postgresqlBuildTableDefinition.
        isIdCurrent is renamed to isPostgresqlIdCurrent.
        row.names is now integer.

Version 0.2-1 -- 2011-11-16

    o   libpq source codes are bundled for Windows.
	In other envirionment, this code is not used and existence of libpq as 
	specified by PG_HOME is still required.

Version 0.2-0 -- 2011-10-04

    o   Error check for dbWriteTable

    o   dbWriteTable does not write a temporary file.
        Control characters in strings are properly escaped for dbWriteTable.

    o   Remove warning for enum and arrays etc.  The value are still transferred
        as string and not converted to arrays etc.

    o   use c('schema', 'table') to specify schema

    o   Integer is mapped to integer in postgresql rather than bigint.

Version 0.1-7 -- 2010-10-17

    o   Several potential buffer overruns were fixed

    o   dbWriteTable now writes a data.frame to database through a network
        connection rather than a temporary file. Note that row_names may be
        changed in future releases.  Also, passing in filenames instead of
        data.frame is not supported at this time. 

    o   When no host is specified, a connection to the PostgreSQL server 
        is made via UNIX domain socket (just like psql does)

    o   Table and column names are case sensitive, and identifiers are escaped
        or quoted appropriately, so that any form of table/column names can be
        created, searched, or removed, including upper-, lower- and mixed-case.

    o   nullOk in dbColumnInfo has a return value of NA when the column does
        not correspond to a column in the table. The utility of nullOk is
        doubtful but not removed at this time.

    o   Correct Windows getpid() declaration (with thanks to Brian D. Ripley)

    o   A call of as.POSIXct() with a time format string wrongly passed to TZ
        has been corrected; this should help with intra-day timestamps (with
        thanks to Steve Eick)

    o   Usage of tmpdir has been improved on similarly to Linux (with thanks
        to Robert McGehee)

Version 0.1-6 -- 2009-10-19

    o   Added missing paste() call to dbGetQuery() for dbListTables

Version 0.1-5 -- 2009-10-13

    o   Four issues reported at the Issue tracker at the Google Code site
        are addressed, two more are feature requests and one cannot be
        replicated

    o   A number of other small fixes and enhancements to code and
        documentation as detailed in the ChangeLog file
