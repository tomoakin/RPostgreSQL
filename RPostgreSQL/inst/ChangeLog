2008-10-28  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: CRAN release 0.1-1

	* tests/*: More cleanup on the tests

	* DESCRIPTION: URL fix

2008-10-21  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* tests/*: Tests are now run if and only if the environment variables
	POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_HOST and POSTGRES_DATABASE are set; the
	variable POSTGRES_PASSWD is also used.  This allows tests to run if
	the local admin wants them to run.
	Thanks to Uwe Ligges for the idea, and to Brian Ripley for supporting
	it. For now, CRAN won't run this though and it is effectively
	disabled in the default test during 'R CMD check' as the vars will
	presumably not be set.

	* configure{,.in}: no longer test for libpq.so as a second
	confirmation as OS X has it as libpq.dylib and would hence always
	fail. Thanks to Jan de Leeuw for the pointer.
