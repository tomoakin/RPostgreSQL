Things yet to be completed:

1. Array and other complex structures are not converted properly:
   just the strings are transmitted.  Datatype conversion callback
   table for supporting complex data types are desired.

2. Add commands for prepared statements.
    This is partly done. But not thoroughly tested yet.

3. More explicit encoding support.

4. 'Scale' is not calculated in dbGetInfo(result_set)
   Try to write an SQL query to get the value or hardcode
   the appropriate details in the code.For more details
   refer to : "RS_PostgreSQL_createDataMappings".

5. Check the working of DBI extension "dbApply".
