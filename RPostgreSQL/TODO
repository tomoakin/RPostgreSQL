Things yet to be Completed:
1. Complete the dbWriteTable part
2. Add the following commands for transaction management:
3. Add hostadr to the connection string & make corresponding changes. (Dont forget to check RCMD       check) and try to add the functionality to specify the connection parameters in any order.
4. Matching between the error messages & error codes in pg.
5. In dbGetInfo(rs), $fieldDescription[[1]]$Sclass & $fieldDescription[[1]]$type are displaying        numbers instead of words (like in SQLite). So Correct the code.
6. Scale & nullOk are not given values yet in dbGetInfo(result_set) because of lack of functions in    pg. So Remove them or try to hardcode the appropriate details in the code.For more details          refer to : "RS_PostgreSQL_createDataMappings".
7. Make test script & a test folder.
8. Improve the documentation & remove the examples from don't run mode.
9. Just verify whether all the key words are included in the reserved keywords section.
10.Add the mappings for all the datatypes in RS-PostgreSQL.h
11.Check whether it works in windows or not & make corresponding changes.
12.Check whether all the data mappings are working perfectly fine & finetune some datatypes like       date,blogs etc..For checking, perform this test. Try to convert a data to & fo via R & pg           and see whether datatype is being preserved.
13.In RS_PostgreSQL_connectionInfo, you are assigning threadid to processid. So Check that.
14.Add comments to the code & some extra files for information sake as in RMySQL & RSQLite.
